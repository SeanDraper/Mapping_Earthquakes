# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this analysis, we added earthquake data to a map for our clients Basil and Sadhana. We took raw JSON data and used javascript to add the data to maps provided by the Mapbox API. We added multiple options for maps including streets, satellite imaging, and dark as well as multiple layers of earthquake data including tectonic plates and major earthquakes.
